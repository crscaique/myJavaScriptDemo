# myJavaScriptDemo

Hello & Welcome!

I created this repository to display some of my JavaScript skills. I am constantly learning and improving my "programming vocab" towards web and desktop programming languages.
It is with great enthusiasm that I deploy some simple, but complete daily life activities that display some of my language knowledge.

**How to access the activities

1 - Each folder represents one project, pull the repository to acquire the full content
2 - The folders' title are straight forward - Ex: Calc - You should expect a Calculator running in the browser
3 - To execute/open the page - Open the desired folder click on the index.html - this will open your default browser and run the program

For contact, please find my LinkedIn in my profile page and feel free to message me!
Thanks!
